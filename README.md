## Overview
Thou art an offence to all that is decent, dog. I challenge you... to a duel!

> Pistols at 10 Blocks is an onchain game, in which you face off against another Lord in a pistol duel to defend your honour.
> A righteous smoulder in your eye and your smoothbore, flintlock pistol held lightly at your side, cocked and ready, you stand
> in the misty morning field. Holding back the gorge rising in your throat, you shake that mongrel's hand and turn, taking your
> first step. Your feet crunch in the crisp morning grass, one step, two steps, three. You hear the snap of a cloak, the gasp
> of your second, and a sharp, booming crack, then your left arm explodes into pain. That traitorous scum shot early! Gritting your
> teeth against the pain, and without turning around, you keep stepping foward. Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine... Ten. You
> turn around, slowly, a dark menace in your shoulder, and raise your pistol. The cur stands there, a defiant sneer upon his face,
> and throws his still smoking pistol to the ground. You take a deep breath, and whisper "May you find honour in death, you wretch!"
> 
> Blood sprays in a beautiful arc from his head, and he drops like a felled log. Silence, interrupteed only by the spattering of
> blood from your arm, into the morning grass.
